            <p>As Soul II Soul said in 1989, "Back to life, back to reality." The Saints handed the Dolphins a piece of reality in front of the entire country on Monday night. But today, I feel the need to talk everyone off the ledge. The season is far from over.</p>

            <p>The Dolphins opened their 2013 season with two games on the road. No one would have thought that, after those two games, we’d be seeing a 2-0 team. Although the Dolphins’ performance has far exceeded the expectations of many fans, there’s still lots of room for improvement. </p>

            <p>The Dolphins opened their 2013 campaign yesterday with win at Cleveland. But today, I have mixed emotions about the outlook of the upcoming season. There are a lot of takeaways from the game, some good, some bad, and some downright nasty. </p>

            <p>Sitting on my couch on a sweltering Tuesday evening in July, I find myself flipping channels trying to pass the time. In the incessant search for mindless entertainment, I find myself settling on NFL Network. On this night, they were replaying old episodes of HBO’s series “Hard Knocks” featuring the Miami Dolphins.</p>

            <small>Submitted by <a href="about.html">Brian</a> on Tue, 12/18/2012</small>
            <p>With another mediocre Dolphins' season about to close, the fans' are in search of the yearly sweeping leadership changes they have come to expect every year. It wouldn't be a Dolphins' offseason without fans clamoring for someone to get fired! This year's public enemy #1: Jeff Ireland.</p>

            <p>Another heartbreaker. But wow, what a game! We learned a lot yesterday about the future of our Dolphins, and the future looks bright. For once, Dolphins fans could walk away from a loss, disappointed but hopeful. But, there's still much room for improvement.</p>

            <small>Submitted by <a href="about.html">Dave</a> on Tue, 01/17/2012</small>
            <p>On January 18th, TDMMC is standing with websites like Wikipedia and Reddit, along with countless others in blacking out our forums for 24 hours in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). If such government overreach is allowed, the Internet will cease to exist as we know it and communities like TDMMC will suffer.</p>

            <h3>Remember Jim Mandich (1948-2011)</h3>
            <small>Submitted by <a href="about.html">Dave</a> on Wed, 04/27/2011</small>
            <p>I didn't love Jim Mandich at first. ...didn't even like him, really. When I really started obsessing over the Dolphins in high school, I had no connection with the teams of the 70s and the Mad Dog was just a guy who screamed over the action on the radio when things went well, frustrating me that I couldn't tell what was going on. Over the years, I realized that Jim was, more than a color guy, a fan of the Dolphins. He cared. And since I cared so much, I started to love him. "Awright Miami!" means something because of him.</p>

            <small>Submitted by <a href="about.html">Dave</a> on Sat, 04/23/2011</small>
            <p>Friends of TDMMC, Igor and Michelle, the founders of Dolfans NYC, are getting people together for the draft. I went to New York for a wedding last year, and was lucky enough to watch the Dolphins/Jets game with a large group that they put together. Seeing the next week's game in their local bar was also a great experience. If you're ever in the area, I HIGHLY recommend seeking this club out on gameday. They put together a great group of real fans.</p>
